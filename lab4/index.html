				<h3>Challenge<h3>

					<p>For this Lab, there weren't many challenges. I did like the challenge of breaking up
						a common and more difficult task into sections as it seems like it makes complex procedures
						much more doable.
					</p>

				<h3>Problems<h3>
					<p>Everything went smoothly for the most part,however, I did forget how to link a div class
						in CSS. Luckily, my lab partner remembered.
					</p>

					<h3>Results<h3>
						<p>The results were simple, yet nice looking lists on another section of my class website.
							As well as an understanding of pseudocode and more practice regarding CSS and HTML syntax.
